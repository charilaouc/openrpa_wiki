IFrames are not supported in Chrome/FireFox (frameset are partially supported) 
IFrames and framesets are partially supported in IE

Robot cannot be run from an UNC share or special One/dropbox/G-drive, all files MUST be located on the local pc.

If recording on a computer with multiple screens, try and only use the primary monitor

Recording with windows display settings where Scale and layout is not set to 100% will not work.
( you can change this back to a non 100% value after recording, if all clicks are virtual )

There is a bug that makes the chrome addon sometimes load multiple times on certain webpages with multiple iframes ( so far I have only located one page with this issue, but other may be affected too )
