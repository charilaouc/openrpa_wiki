If recording on a computer with multiple screens, try and only use the primary monitor

Recording with windows display settings where Scale and layout is not set to 100% will not work.
( you can change this back to a non 100% value after recording, if all clicks are virtual )

If the robot crashes while loading addons and you have anaconda Python installed, please uninstall Scripting support in the robot ( or delete C:\Program Files\OpenRPA\OpenRPA.Script.dll)
You can also try and install Python 3.5 following [this guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/#anaconda-faq-35)
