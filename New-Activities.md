Add new workitem to the selected Workitem Queue. You can add an unlimited number of parameters using the Payload Property. You can also add as many files as you want, by setting "Files" to an array for strings with the full path and filename to the files you want to attach to the workitem.
You can schedule this workitem to not be processed until a specific date/time by setting Next Run. 
If some items are more important than others and you often have many work items in status "new", you can set Priority to prioritize them items. ( the lower the number, the more important it is )
