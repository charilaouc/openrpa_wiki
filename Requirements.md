If you enable a click or element detector the robot will be monitoring every mouse click on the computer, and on very lowend computers this can give a few miliseconds delay on clicks and show a little CPU usage on the robot. But most pc this is a non-issue.
The robot, if not configured on offline mode, will require a working network connection to start. Once in sync with openflow it will function even if the network goes a wait for short periods of time.
The robot uses WebSockets to connect with OpenFlow, if using a firewill that does layer 4 inspection or using a procy server, be sure to check this supports WebSockets. If you are using https://app.openiap.io be aware this is running in Google Cloud, so for people in certain countries, this can be a issue. If you are hit by any of those issues, feel free to create your own installation of OpenFlow, in a nother network or On-premise.
