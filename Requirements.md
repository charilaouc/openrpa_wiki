The robot, if not configured on offline mode, will require a working network connection to start. Once in sync with openflow it will function even if the network goes a wait for a short periods of time.
The robot uses WebSockets to connect with OpenFlow, if using a firewall that does layer 4 inspection or if you are using a proxy server, be sure to check this supports WebSockets. 

If you are using https://app.openiap.io be aware this is running in Google Cloud, so for people in certain countries, this can be a issue. 

If you are hit by any of last two issues, feel free to create your own installation of OpenFlow, in another network or On-premise.
